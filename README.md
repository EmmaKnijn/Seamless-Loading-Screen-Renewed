# Seamless Loading Screen: Renewed

**Seamless Loading Screen: Renewed** is a **fabric** mod that takes a screenshot of the game when you leave a world or server, and displays it when you rejoin it.

This was created because the original mod wasn't kept up to date anymore

**Important**: You have to quit using the pause menu. Closing via the window's x, will not take the screenshot
